# History

This project is based on code developed during project development course than ran during Summer 2019. The goal was to write a massage booking system for Unity Technologies Finland. This app was tailored for their use case and therefore makes assumptions about the massage hours and rules relating to the reservations. The original code with commit history can be found [here](https://github.com/karoliinaemilia/massage-booking-system). This repository exists for refactoring practise.
